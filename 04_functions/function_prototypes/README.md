# Function Prototypes

The compiler must 'know' about a function before it is used

- Define functions before calling them

  - OK for small programs
  - Not a practical solution for larger programs

- Use function prototypes
  - Tells the compiler what it needs to know without a full function definition
  - Also called forward declarations
  - Placed at the beginning of the program
  - Also used in our own header files (.h) - more about this later
