# Recursive Functions

- A recursive function is a function that calls itself
  - Either directly or indirectly through another function
- Recursive problem solving
  - Base case
  - Divide the rest of problem into subproblem and do recursive call
- There are many problems that lend themselves to recursive solutions
- Mathematic - factorial, Fibonacci, fractals,...
- Searching and sorting - binary search, search tree,...

# Important notes

- If recursion doesn't eventually stop you will have infinite recursion
- Recursion can be resource intensive
- Remember the base case(s)
  - It terminates the recursion
- Only use recursive solutions when it makes sense
- Anything that can be done recursively can be done iteratively
  - Stack overflow error
